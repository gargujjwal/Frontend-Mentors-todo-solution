## My process

### Built with

-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
-   [dnd kit](https://dndkit.com/) - Drag & Drop JS library

### What I learned

During my learning experience, I acquired the knowledge to implement drag and drop functionality using [dnd kit](https://dndkit.com/). It allowed me to seamlessly move and rearrange elements within my application. This feature greatly enhanced the user experience and added a dynamic and interactive element to my project.
